# Advanced Practices and Ideas for WoW Addon Development

## 1. Set Up GitHub Integration

1.1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and log in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "MyWoWAddon")
   - Leave it public unless you want to pay for a private repository
   - Don't initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

1.2. Link your local project to GitHub:
   - In VS Code's terminal, type these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):
     ```
     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MyWoWAddon.git
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push -u origin main
     ```

1.3. Install GitHub extension in VS Code:
   - Go to the Extensions view again
   - Search for "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues"
   - Click "Install"

## 2. Set Up CurseForge Integration

2.1. Install CurseForge CLI:
   - Go to [https://authors.curseforge.com/knowledge-base/projects/529-curseforge-cli](https://authors.curseforge.com/knowledge-base/projects/529-curseforge-cli)
   - Download the CLI for your operating system
   - Follow the installation instructions on the page

2.2. Create a CurseForge API token:
   - Go to [https://authors.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens](https://authors.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens)
   - Click "Generate Token"

2.3. Set up CurseForge CLI:
   - In VS Code's terminal, type:
     ```
     curseforge config set api-token YOUR_API_TOKEN
     ```
   - Replace YOUR_API_TOKEN with the token you just generated

2.4. Create a .curseforge folder:
   - In VS Code, right-click in the file explorer and select "New Folder"
   - Name it ".curseforge" (including the dot)

2.5. Create a project-metadata.json file:
   - In the .curseforge folder, create a new file named "project-metadata.json"
   - Add this content (replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID and other placeholders):
     ```json
     {
       "projectId": YOUR_PROJECT_ID,
       "projectSlug": "your-project-slug",
       "fileId": null,
       "gameVersions": [90205],
       "releaseType": "release",
       "relations": {
         "projects": []
       }
     }
     ```

## 3. Set Up Task Automation in VS Code

3.1. Create a tasks.json file:
   - In VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
   - Type "Tasks: Configure Task" and select it
   - Choose "Create tasks.json file from template"
   - Select "Others"

3.2. Replace the content of tasks.json with:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "2.0.0",
     "tasks": [
       {
         "type": "shell",
         "label": "Deploy Addon",
         "command": "cp -R ${workspaceFolder} PATH_TO_WOW_ADDON_FOLDER",
         "group": "build",
         "problemMatcher": []
       },
       {
         "type": "shell",
         "label": "Package for CurseForge",
         "command": "curseforge upload ${workspaceFolder}",
         "group": "build",
         "problemMatcher": []
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3.3. Replace PATH_TO_WOW_ADDON_FOLDER with the actual path to your WoW addons folder

## 4. Best Practices for Addon Development

4.1. Regular updates:
   - Keep your addon's TOC file updated with the correct WoW version
   - Update your README.md file with information about your addon
   - Maintain a changelog to track your addon's development

4.2. Code organization:
   - Use modules to separate different functionalities
   - Implement a config system for user-adjustable settings
   - Use localization to support multiple languages

4.3. Performance optimization:
   - Minimize the use of OnUpdate scripts
   - Use efficient data structures (e.g., hash tables for frequent lookups)
   - Implement throttling for frequent events

4.4. User interface:
   - Follow Blizzard's UI guidelines for consistency
   - Implement slash commands for easy access to addon functions
   - Consider creating a config panel for in-game settings

4.5. Error handling:
   - Implement proper error catching and logging
   - Provide users with clear error messages
   - Consider implementing a debug mode for troubleshooting

4.6. Version control best practices:
   - Commit often with clear, descriptive messages
   - Use branches for developing new features
   - Implement semantic versioning for your addon

4.7. Community engagement:
   - Respond to user feedback and bug reports
   - Maintain clear documentation for your addon
   - Engage with the WoW addon development community for support and collaboration

This concludes the advanced practices and ideas guide for WoW addon development.
